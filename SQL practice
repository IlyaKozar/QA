Here is a structure of a DB that I was working with.

5 tables: 
         1) "directors" with movie_id and person_id
         2) "movies" with id, title and year
         3) "people" with id, name and birth
         4) "ratings" with movie_id, rating and votes
         5) "stars" with movie_id and person_id

TASKS:

      1) Display a list of titles of all films of 2010
      2) Display the year of birth of the actress Emma Stone
      3) Display all movies released in or after 2018 in alphabetical order
      4) Display the number of movies with a rating of 10.0
      5) Display movie titles that have a rating of 10.0
      6) Display a list of all Harry Potter movies in chronological order
      7) Display the average rating of all films of 2012
      8) Display the names of all the actors who played in Toy Story

      10) Display 5 movies with the highest rating where Brad Pitt played
      11) Display all movies where Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie played together
      
Practice:
      
      1) SELECT title FROM movies WHERE year = 2010
      2) SELECT birth FROM people WHERE name = "Emma Stone"
      3) SELECT title FROM movies WHERE year >= 2018  ORDER BY title
      4) SELECT count (rating) FROM ratings WHERE rating = 10.0
      5) SELECT title FROM movies join ratings on ratings.movie_id = movies.id  WHERE rating = 10.0 
      6) SELECT title FROM movies where title like "%Harry Potter%" ORDER BY year
      7) SELECT avg (rating) FROM ratings JOIN movies ON ratings.movie_id = movies.id WHERE year = 2012 
      8) SELECT name FROM people JOIN stars ON stars.person_id = people.id JOIN movies ON movies.id = stars.movie_id WHERE title = "Toy Story"
      or
      8) SELECT name FROM people WHERE id IN (SELECT person_id FROM stars WHERE movie_id = (SELECT id FROM movies WHERE title = "Toy Story" )) 
      9) SELECT name, birth FROM people JOIN directors ON directors.person_id = people.id JOIN movies ON movies.id = directors.movie_id WHERE title = "Toy Story"
      or
      9) SELECT name, birth FROM people WHERE id = (SELECT person_id FROM directors WHERE movie_id = (SELECT id FROM movies where title = "Toy Story"))
      10) SELECT title FROM ratings JOIN movies ON ratings.movie_id = movies.id JOIN stars ON stars.movie_id = movies.id JOIN people ON stars.person_id = people.id WHERE name = "Brad Pitt" ORDER BY rating DESC LIMIT 5
      or
      10) SELECT title FROM movies JOIN ratings ON ratings.movie_id = movies.id WHERE id IN (SELECT movie_id FROM stars WHERE person_id IN (SELECT id from people WHERE name = "Brad Pitt") ) ORDER BY rating DESC LIMIT 5
      11) SELECT title FROM movies WHERE id IN (SELECT movie_id FROM stars WHERE person_id IN (SELECT id from people where name = "Angelina Jolie") ) AND id IN (SELECT movie_id FROM stars WHERE person_id IN (SELECT id from people where name = "Brad Pitt") ) 
      or
      11) SELECT title FROM movies JOIN stars ON movies.id = stars.movie_id JOIN people ON stars.person_id = people.id WHERE name IN ("Angelina Jolie", "Brad Pitt") GROUP BY title HAVING count(title)>1
